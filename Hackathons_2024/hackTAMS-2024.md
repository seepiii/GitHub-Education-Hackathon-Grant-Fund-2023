hackTAMS
hackTAMS is the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science’s annual, student-run hackathon targeted towards high school students in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area. Currently, there is a serious lack of quality, free hackathons for high school students in the DFW area, the 4th most populated metropolitan area in the country. We want
hackTAMS to fill this void. This 24 hour event welcomes students regardless of programming experience. We want to create a welcoming and diverse community of hackers that fosters a passion and interest for programming, problem solving, and innovation. Furthermore, we also aim to provide attendees with a fun and informative experience by hosting workshops, guest and industry speakers, and other activities during the hackathon.

Event Summary
hackTAMS lets high school students from across Texas showcase their talent and creativity through coding projects and presentations. Students had access to workshops, guest speakers, networking opportunities, and other fun and informative events while working on their projects. We held workshops to teach various participants skills like Machine Learning or website development to help improve their projects. We also held a panel with current industry workers (Mr. Tahir from Dialexa and Ben from MLH) and college students (TAMS alumni) at UT Austin to educate high schoolers about the workforce and college. Participants were required to submit their projects using GitHub. We also taught many first-time coders how to set up a repository and submit their work through GitHub.

Tech Impact / Diversity
Tell us about your hacker demographics
Our target audience was primarily high school students, in order to give people a first experience of hackathons and coding. We had students from multiple areas and backgrounds across DFW.

Where were your hackers from?
|100% North America|

Impact of GitHub Grant
How did you use the grant funds?
We utilized the grant to account for venue, prize, food, and supplies purchases so hackers had everything they needed for an enjoyable and informative experience.

How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants?
We had an all-time high of 117 in-person participants; the funds helped us provide for everyone who came to the Willis Library venue and allowed all the hackers to be well-fed, hydrated, and happy with the prizes they received. It also allowed us to account for any last-minute expenses we had that we didn’t account for. For example, when one of our food sponsors pulled out at the last minute, we could still get enough food for all of our hackers (lunch Sunday--Subway) because of the funds we received from the GitHub Grant.

Top Projects
One of the most innovative projects we received was a project called Doodlor, where, utilizing AI, the application could take your drawing and turn it into a full art piece. All of the projects at hackTAMS were unique and addressed problems in a wide array of fields.

What’s Next?
hackTAMS 2024 was very successful; we plan on increasing the number of participants, speakers, and sponsors, at hackTAMS 2025. We were overall very happy with how the event went this year and we seek to only improve upon the quality of hackTAMS 2024.
